## Create Snowflake trial

Go to [signup.snowflake.com](https://signup.snowflake.com/) and create a trial

Choose
 - Enterprise (the higher the tier, the more features and more expensive compute)
 - AWS (newer Snowflake features are rolled out on AWS before other platforms)
 - Location (just what is closest to you)

## The advanced part

We will use a Python, git and, docker to load data into Snowflake.

### Install Python

Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/), download and install Python.

On Windows you should choose **Add Python to PATH**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7769335/159690932-944f52aa-f543-4b3b-8501-f72ceead2530.png)

### Test Python installation

- **On Windows:** open CMD
- **On Mac:** open Terminal

Run the following command:

```bash
python --version
```
*Or, if that didn't work, try:*
```bash
python3 --version
```

If you see something like this, Python is installed correctly:

### Install docker desktop

Install Docker desktop from: [www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

You may need to create an account on [hub.docker.com/signup](https://hub.docker.com/signup)

### Install git 

#### On Mac

Type this in to the Terminal:

```bash
git --version
```

If git is installed, you will see the installed version number.

If git inn't installed, the installation will start.

#### On Windows

Install from [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win) choose **64-bit Git for Windows Setup.**
